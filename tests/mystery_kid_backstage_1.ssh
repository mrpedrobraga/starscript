--rack2
	* It's not yet time for you to wear a suit.
--vhs

	* It seems like it consists of sitcoms.[br][input]* But it was spliced to contain only the laugh tracks.
--garbage
	* Ew,[pause 2] it's trash.
--papers
	* It's several pages of paper written with glitter pens.
	* In it, alternate scripts for this very encounter.

--papers2
	* One of the papers has a marking in red saying
	* "Rude! Stop looking at other people's stuff."
